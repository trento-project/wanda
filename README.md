A service responsible to orchestrate Checks executions on a target infrastructure.

# Documentation

The documentation is available at [trento-project.io/wanda](https://trento-project.io/wanda/).

Swagger UI is available at [trento-project.io/wanda/swaggerui](https://trento-project.io/wanda/swaggerui).

# Developing Checks

Wanda architecture aims to simplify [testing Checks Executions](#testing-executions) and [adding new ones](#adding-new-checks).

## Infrastructure

For development purposes, a [docker-compose file](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) is provided.
The [docker-compose.checks.yaml](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda/blob/main/docker-compose.checks.yaml) provides additional configuration to start an environment for Checks development.

### Starting a local environment

Start the environment with:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.checks.yaml up -d
```

Wanda is exposed on port `4000` and the API documentation is available at http://localhost:4000/swaggerui

**Note** that the [message broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) **must** be reachable by Wanda and all the targets.

## Testing Executions

With a running setup, it is possible to easily test Checks and their Execution by:

- starting the targets
- consulting the catalog
- starting a Checks Execution
- checking the state of an execution
- debugging the gathered facts

### **Starting the targets**

The [trento-agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) must be up and running on the targets to run a correct execution, otherwise a timeout error is raised.

Here an example on how to start it:

```
./trento-agent start --api-key <api-key> --facts-service-url amqp://wanda:wanda@localhost:5674
```

> Note: `api-key` value is not used if the unique goal is to run checks, so setting it as `--api-key 0` does the work.

Keep in mind that the `agent_id` of the targets must match with values provided in the `targets` field of the execution request.

The ID can be obtained running:

```
./trento-agent id
```

If the execution is run in a development/testing environment, [faking the agent id](https://github.com/trento-project/agent#fake-agent-id) might come handy.

### **Consulting the catalog**

Available Checks are part of the **Catalog**, and they can be retrieved by accessing the dedicated API

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/catalog' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### **Starting a Checks Execution**

A Checks Execution can be started by calling the Start Execution endpoint, as follows

```bash
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/start' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "env": {
    "provider": "azure"
  },
  "execution_id": "205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3",
  "group_id": "3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12",
  "targets": [
    {
      "agent_id": "a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894",
      "checks": [
        "156F64"
      ]
    },
    {
      "agent_id": "02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620",
      "checks": [
        "OTH3R1"
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

> **execution_id** must be new and unique for every new execution. If an already used **execution_id** is provided, starting the execution fails.

In order to get detailed information for an execution, see [Getting Execution details](#getting-execution-details).

> Note that execution is _eventually started_, meaning that a successful response to the previous API call does not guarantee that the execution is running, but that it has been accepted by the system to start.

### Execution Targets

An execution target is a target host where the checks are executed. This requires to have the `trento-agent` executable running in the host. In order to specify an execution order, its `agent_id` and a list of checks to be executed are provided. Once the execution is started, a facts gathering request is sent to these targets, facts are gathered and sent back to Wanda, where the checks result is evaluated using the gathered facts.

The `agent_id` can be obtained just issuing `trento-agent id` command in the target host.

Each target _must_ specify a list of checks, that can be empty. These are the selected checks for each agent, that are executed.

Given two different targets, the same checks can be selected:

```bash
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/start' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "env": {
    "provider": "azure"
  },
  "execution_id": "205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3",
  "group_id": "3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12",
  "targets": [
    {
      "agent_id": "a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894",
      "checks": [
        "156F64",
        "45B653"
      ]
    },
    {
      "agent_id": "02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620",
      "checks": [
        "156F64",
        "45B653"
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

Or completely different ones:

```bash
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/start' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "env": {
    "provider": "azure"
  },
  "execution_id": "205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3",
  "group_id": "3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12",
  "targets": [
    {
      "agent_id": "a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894",
      "checks": [
        "156F64",
        "45B653"
      ]
    },
    {
      "agent_id": "02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620",
      "checks": [
        "OTH3R1",
        "OTH3R2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

### **Getting Execution details**

To get detailed information about the execution, the following API can be used.

```bash
curl --request GET 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

> **Note** that calling the execution detail API right after [starting an execution](#starting-a-checks-execution) might result in a `404 not found`, because the execution, as mentioned, is _eventually started_.
>
> In this case retry getting the detail of the execution.

Refer to the [API doc](http://localhost:4000/swaggerui) for more information about requests and responses.

### **Debugging gathered facts**

Often times knowing the returned value of the gathered facts is not a trivial thing, more during the implementation of new checks.

To better debug the fact gathering process and the returned values, the `facts` subcommand of `trento-agent` is a really useful tool. This command helps to see in the target itself what the gathered fact looks like. This is specially interesting when the returned value is a complex object or the target under test is modified and the check developer wants to see how this affects the gathered fact.

The command can be used as:

```
./trento-agent facts gather --gatherer corosync.conf --argument totem.token
# To see the currently available gatherers and their names
# ./trento-agent facts list
```

Which would return the next where the `Value` is the available value in the written check:

```
{
  "Name": "totem.token",
  "CheckID": "",
  "Value": {
    "Value": 30000
  },
  "Error": null
}
```

## Adding new Checks

Built-in Checks can be found in the Catalog directory at `./priv/catalog/`

To implement new checks and test them:

- write a new [Check Specification](./guides/specification.md) file
- locate the newly created Check in the Catalog directory `./priv/catalog/`
- test the execution as [previously described](#testing-executions)

# Running a local Wanda instance

## Running a Development Environment

To set up a local development environment for Wanda, follow the instructions provided in [how to hack on wanda](./guides/development/hack_on_wanda.md).

This guide walks through the process of installing and configuring the necessary dependencies, as well as setting up a local development environment.

## Running a Demo Environment

The demo mode of Wanda allows to showcase checks evaluation without the full setup with actual agents on the host. To run a demo instance, follow the instructions provided in [how to run wanda demo guide](./guides/development/demo.md).
