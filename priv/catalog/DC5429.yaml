  Corosync version is supported
remediation: |
  ## Abstract
  Installed Corosync version must be equal or higher than the recommended version (2.4.5)

  ## Remediation
  Install or upgrade to a supported Corosync version

  ## Reference
  The recommended minimal version of the corosync package is 2.4.5 as we had seen some 'split brain' situations and other communication problems with corosync versions older than 2.4.5.
  It is the *first* version supported with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP2 and it is also available as a maintenance update in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP1.
