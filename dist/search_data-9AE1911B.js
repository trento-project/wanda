Executions - Wanda","doc":"With a running setup, it is possible to easily test Checks and their Execution by:\n\n- starting the targets\n- consulting the catalog\n- starting a Checks Execution\n- checking the state of an execution\n- debugging the gathered facts\n\n### **Starting the targets**\n\nThe [trento-agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) must be up and running on the targets to run a correct execution, otherwise a timeout error is raised.\n\nHere an example on how to start it:\n\n```\n./trento-agent start --api-key   --facts-service-url amqp://wanda:wanda@localhost:5674\n```\n\n> Note: `api-key` value is not used if the unique goal is to run checks, so setting it as `--api-key 0` does the work.\n\nKeep in mind that the `agent_id` of the targets must match with values provided in the `targets` field of the execution request.\n\nThe ID can be obtained running:\n\n```\n./trento-agent id\n```\n\nIf the execution is run in a development/testing environment, [faking the agent id](https://github.com/trento-project/agent#fake-agent-id) might come handy.\n\n### **Consulting the catalog**\n\nAvailable Checks are part of the **Catalog**, and they can be retrieved by accessing the dedicated API\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n  'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/catalog' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json'\n```\n\n### **Starting a Checks Execution**\n\nA Checks Execution can be started by calling the Start Execution endpoint, as follows\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST

This requires to have the `trento-agent` executable running in the host. In order to specify an execution order, its `agent_id` and a list of checks to be executed are provided. Once the execution is started, a facts gathering request is sent to these targets, facts are gathered and sent back to Wanda, where the checks result is evaluated using the gathered facts.\n\nThe `agent_id` can be obtained just issuing `trento-agent id` command in the target host.\n\nEach target _must_ specify a list of checks, that can be empty. These are the selected checks for each agent, that are executed.\n\nGiven two different targets, the same checks can be selected:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/start' \\\n--header 'accept: application/json' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"provider\": \"azure\"\n  },\n  \"execution_id\": \"205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3\",\n  \"group_id\": \"3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12\",\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"agent_id\": \"a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894\",\n      \"checks\": [\n        \"156F64\",\n        \"45B653\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"agent_id\": \"02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620\",\n      \"checks\": [\n        \"156F64\",\n        \"45B653\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n```\n\nOr completely different ones:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/start' \\\n--header 'accept: application/json' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"provider\": \"azure\"\n  },\n  \"execution_id\": \"205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3\",\n  \"group_id\": \"3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12\",\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"agent_id\": \"a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894\",\n      \"checks\": [\n        \"156F64\",\n        \"45B653\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"agent_id\": \"02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620\",\n      \"checks\": [\n        \"OTH3R1\",\n        \"OTH3R2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n```\n\n### **Getting Execution details**\n\nTo get detailed information about the execution, the following API can be used.\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1/checks/executions/205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3' \\\n--header 'accept: application/json' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\n> **Note** that calling the execution detail API right after [starting an execution](#starting-a-checks-execution) might result in a `404 not found`, because the execution, as mentioned, is _eventually started_.\n>\n> In this case retry getting the detail of the execution.\n\nRefer to the [API doc](http://localhost:4000/swaggerui) for more information about requests and responses.\n\n### **Debugging gathered facts**\n\nOften times knowing the returned value of the gathered facts is not a trivial thing, more during the implementation of new checks.\n\nTo better debug the fact gathering process and the returned values, the `facts` subcommand of `trento-agent` is a really useful tool. This command helps to see in the target itself what the gathered fact looks like. This is specially interesting when the returned value is a complex object or the target under test is modified and the check developer wants to see how this affects the gathered fact.\n\nThe command can be used as:\n\n```\n./trento-agent facts gather --gatherer corosync.conf --argument totem.token\n# To see the currently available gatherers and their names\n# ./trento-agent facts list\n```\n\nWhich would return the next where the `Value` is the available value in the written check:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Name\": \"totem.token\",\n  \"CheckID\": \"\",\n  \"Value\": {\n    \"Value\": 30000\n  },\n  \"Error\": null\n}\n```\n\n# Running a local Wanda instance","ref":"readme.html#execution-targets"},{"type":"extras","title":"Running a Development Environment - Wanda","doc":"To set up a local development environment for Wanda, follow the instructions provided in [how to hack on wanda](./guides/development/hack_on_wanda.md).\n\nThis guide walks through the process of installing and configuring the necessary dependencies, as well as setting up a local development environment.","ref":"readme.html#running-a-development-environment"},{"type":"extras","title":"Running a Demo Environment - Wanda","doc":"The demo mode of Wanda allows to showcase checks evaluation without the full setup with actual agents on the host.

Checks Specification","doc":"To have a standardized format for writing checks, follow the next best practices and conventions as much as possible:\n\n- The `id` field must be wrapped in double quotes to avoid any type of ambiguity, as this field must be of string format.\n- The remaining `name`, `description`, `group`, and `remediation` fields must not be wrapped in quotes, as they are text-based values always.\n- Take advantage of markdown tags in the `name`, `description`, and `remediation` fields to make the text easy and compelling to read.\n- The `name` field of `facts`, `values`, and `expectations` must follow `camel_case` format.  \n  For example:\n  ```\n  facts:\n    - name: some_fact\n  ...\n  values:\n    - name: expected_some_fact\n  ...\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n  ...\n  ```\n- Use 2 spaces to indent multiline expectation expressions.\n- Naming hardcoded values in the `values` section with the `default` field is encouraged instead of putting hardcoded values in the expectation expression itself. This gives some meaning to the expected value and improves potential interaction with the Wanda API.  \n  So this:\n\n  ```\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n      expect: facts.foo == 30\n  ```\n\n  would be:\n\n  ```\n  values:\n    - name: expected_foo\n      default: 30\n\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n      expect: facts.foo == values.expected_foo\n  ```\n\n- If the gathered fact is compared to a value, using `value` and `expected_value` names for facts and values respectively is recommended, as it improves the meaning of the comparison.  \n  For example:\n  ```\n  facts:\n    - name: some_fact\n  ...\n  values:\n    - name: expected_some_fact\n  ...\n  ```\n- Avoid adding prefixes such as `facts` or `values` to the entries of these sections, as they already use this as a namespace.\n  For example, the next example should be avoided, as the `facts` prefix would be redundant in the expectation expression:\n  ```\n  facts:\n    - name: facts_some_fact\n  ```\n- If the implemented expectation expression contains any kind of `&&` to combine multiple operations, consider adding them as individual expectations, as the final result is the combination of all of them.  \n  So this:\n  ```\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n      expect: facts.foo == values.expected_foo && facts.bar == values.expected_bar\n  ```\n  would be:\n  ```\n  expectations:\n    - name: foo_expectation\n      expect: facts.foo == values.expected_foo\n    - name: bar_expectation\n      expect: facts.bar == values.expected_bar\n  ```\n- Pipe the expression language functions vertically in order to provide a better visual output of the code.  \n  So this:\n  ```\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n      expect: facts.foo.find(|item| item.id == \"super\").properties.find(|prop| prop.name == \"good\").value\n  ```\n  would be:\n  ```\n  expectations:\n    - name: some_expectation\n      expect: |\n        facts.foo\n        .find(|item| item.id == \"super\").properties\n        .find(|prop| prop.name == \"good\").value\n  ```\n  > Note: Keep in mind that some functions such as `sort` and `drain` run in-place modifications, so they cannot be piped.","ref":"specification.html#best-practices-and-conventions"},{"type":"extras","title":"Expression Language","doc":"# Expression Language\n\nA small, fast, easy-to-use scripting language and evaluation engine.","ref":"expression_language.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Introduction - Expression Language","doc":"An embedded scripting language and evaluation engine for Trento Checks Expressions that gives a safe and easy way to script specific steps during Checks Execution.","ref":"expression_language.html#introduction"},{"type":"extras","title":"Types - Expression Language","doc":"| Type                           | Example                  |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| **Nothing/void/nil/null/Unit** | `()`                     |\n| **Integer**                    | `42`, `123`              |\n| **Float**                      | `123.4567`               |\n| **Boolean**                    | `true` or `false`        |\n| **String**                     | `\"hello\"`                |\n| **Array**                      | `[ 1, 2, 3, \"foobar\" ]`  |\n| **Map**                        | `#{ \"a\": 1, \"b\": true }` |","ref":"expression_language.html#types"},{"type":"extras","title":"Logic Operators and Boolean - Expression Language","doc":"| Operator | Description (`x` _operator_ `y`) | `x`, `y` same type or are numeric | `x`, `y` different types |\n| :------: | ------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------: |\n|   `==`   | `x` is equals to `y`                 |       error if not defined        |  `false` if not defined  |\n|   `!=`   | `x` is not equals to `y`             |       error if not defined        |  `true` if not defined   |\n|   `>`    | `x` is greater than `y`              |       error if not defined        |  `false` if not defined  |\n|   `>=`   | `x` is greater than or equals to `y` |       error if not defined        |  `false` if not defined  |\n|   `<`    | `x` is less than `y`                 |       error if not defined        |  `false` if not defined  |\n|   `<=`   | `x` is less than or equals to `y`    |       error if not defined        |  `false` if not defined  |","ref":"expression_language.html#logic-operators-and-boolean"},{"type":"extras","title":"Comparing different types defaults to false - Expression Language","doc":"Comparing two values of _different_ data types defaults to `false`.\n\nThe exception is `!=` (not equals) which defaults to `true`.
