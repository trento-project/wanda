Documentation The documentation is available at trento-project.io/wanda . Swagger UI is available at trento-project.io/wanda/swaggerui .","ref":"readme.html","title":"Wanda","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Wanda architecture aims to simplify testing Checks Executions and adding new ones . Infrastructure For development purposes, a docker-compose file is provided. The docker-compose.checks.yaml provides additional configuration to start an environment for Checks development. Starting a local environment Start the environment with: $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.checks.yaml up -d Wanda is exposed on port 4000 and the API documentation is available at http://localhost:4000/swaggerui Note that the message broker must be reachable by Wanda and all the targets. Testing Executions With a running setup, it is possible to easily test Checks and their Execution by: starting the targets consulting the catalog starting a Checks Execution checking the state of an execution debugging the gathered facts Starting the targets The trento-agent must be up and running on the targets to run a correct execution, otherwise a timeout error is raised. Here an example on how to start it: . / trento - agent start -- api - key &lt; api - key &gt; -- facts - service - url amqp :// wanda :wanda@localhost : 5674 Note: api-key value is not used if the unique goal is to run checks, so setting it as --api-key 0 does the work. Keep in mind that the agent_id of the targets must match with values provided in the targets field of the execution request. The ID can be obtained running: . / trento - agent id If the execution is run in a development/testing environment, faking the agent id might come handy. Consulting the catalog Available Checks are part of the Catalog , and they can be retrieved by accessing the dedicated API curl -X &#39;GET&#39; \\ &#39;http://localhost:4000/api/checks/catalog&#39; \\ -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; Starting a Checks Execution A Checks Execution can be started by calling the Start Execution endpoint, as follows curl --request POST &#39;http://localhost:4000/api/checks/executions/start&#39; \\ --header &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\ --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ --data-raw &#39;{ &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;azure&quot; }, &quot;execution_id&quot;: &quot;205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3&quot;, &quot;group_id&quot;: &quot;3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12&quot;, &quot;targets&quot;: [ { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;156F64&quot; ] }, { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;OTH3R1&quot; ] } ] }&#39; execution_id must be new and unique for every new execution. If an already used execution_id is provided, starting the execution fails. In order to get detailed information for an execution, see Getting Execution details . Please note that execution is eventually started , meaning that a successful response to the previous API call does not guarantee that the execution is running, but that it has been accepted by the system to start. Execution Targets An execution target is a target host where the checks are executed. This requires to have the trento-agent executable running in the host. In order to specify an execution order, its agent_id and a list of checks to be executed are provided. Once the execution is started, a facts gathering request is sent to these targets, facts are gathered and sent back to Wanda, where the checks result is evaluated using the gathered facts. The agent_id can be obtained just issuing trento-agent id command in the target host. Each target must specify a list of checks, that can be empty. These are the selected checks for each agent, that are executed. Given two different targets, the same checks can be selected: curl --request POST &#39;http://localhost:4000/api/checks/executions/start&#39; \\ --header &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\ --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ --data-raw &#39;{ &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;azure&quot; }, &quot;execution_id&quot;: &quot;205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3&quot;, &quot;group_id&quot;: &quot;3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12&quot;, &quot;targets&quot;: [ { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;156F64&quot;, &quot;45B653&quot; ] }, { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;156F64&quot;, &quot;45B653&quot; ] } ] }&#39; Or completely different ones: curl --request POST &#39;http://localhost:4000/api/checks/executions/start&#39; \\ --header &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\ --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ --data-raw &#39;{ &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;azure&quot; }, &quot;execution_id&quot;: &quot;205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3&quot;, &quot;group_id&quot;: &quot;3dff9d03-4adf-453e-9513-8533e221bb12&quot;, &quot;targets&quot;: [ { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;a644919a-d953-43d4-bd57-7e0bb96ee894&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;156F64&quot;, &quot;45B653&quot; ] }, { &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;02d99b2f-0efd-443c-ac9c-32710323f620&quot;, &quot;checks&quot;: [ &quot;OTH3R1&quot;, &quot;OTH3R2&quot; ] } ] }&#39; Getting Execution details To get detailed information about the execution, the following API can be used. curl --request GET &#39;http://localhost:4000/api/checks/executions/205e326d-0c25-4f4b-9976-43f9ba1c86d3&#39; \\ --header &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\ --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; Note that calling the execution detail API right after starting an execution might result in a 404 not found , because the execution, as mentioned, is eventually started . In this case retry getting the detail of the execution. Refer to the API doc for more information about requests and responses. Debugging gathered facts Often times knowing the returned value of the gathered facts is not a trivial thing, more during the implementation of new checks. To better debug the fact gathering process and the returned values the facts subcommand of trento-agent is a really useful tool. This command helps to see in the target itself what the gathered fact looks like. This is specially interesting when the returned value is a complex object or the target under test is modified and the check developer wants to see how this affects to the gathered fact. The command can be used as: . / trento - agent facts gather -- gatherer corosync . conf -- argument totem . token # To see the currently available gatherers and their names # ./trento-agent facts list Which would return the next where the Value is the available value in the written check: { &quot;Name&quot; : &quot;totem.token&quot; , &quot;CheckID&quot; : &quot;&quot; , &quot;Value&quot; : { &quot;Value&quot; : 30000 } , &quot;Error&quot; : null } Adding new Checks Built-in Checks can be found in the Catalog directory at ./priv/catalog/ To implement new checks and test them: write a new Check Specification file locate the newly created Check in the Catalog directory ./priv/catalog/ test the execution as previously described Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md License Copyright 2021-2022 SUSE LLC Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use any of the source code in this project except in compliance with the License.

Check that your code is not generating new warnings. Check that any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules Commit history should be short and group changes that otherwise wouldn't make sense on their own. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this: git commit - m &quot;A brief summary of the commit A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.&quot; Write a detailed description that gives context and explains why you are creating the PR.

Then the Execution waits for the Facts Gathering to complete. Facts Gathering After an Execution Request the targets are notified about the facts they need to gather .

The remaining name , description , group , and remediation fields must not be wrapped in quotes, as they are text-based values always. Take advantage of markdown tags in the name , description , and remediation fields to make the text easy and compelling to read. The name field of facts , values , and expectations must follow camel_case format. For example: facts : - name : some_fact ... values : - name : expected_some_fact ... expectations : - name : some_expectation ... Use 2 spaces to indent multiline expectation expressions. Naming hardcoded values in the values section with the default field is encouraged instead of putting hardcoded values in the expectation expression itself. This gives some meaning to the expected value and improves potential interaction with the Wanda API. So this: expectations : - name : some_expectation expect : facts . foo == 30 would be: values : - name : expected_foo default : 30 expectations : - name : some_expectation expect : facts . foo == values . expected_foo If the gathered fact is compared to a value, using value and expected_value names for facts and values respectively is recommended, as it improves the meaning of the comparison. For example: facts : - name : some_fact ... values : - name : expected_some_fact ... Avoid adding prefixes such as facts or values to the entries of these sections, as they already use this as a namespace. For example, the next example should be avoided, as the facts prefix would be redundant in the expectation expression: facts : - name : facts_some_fact If the implemented expectation expression contains any kind of &amp;&amp; to combine multiple operations, consider adding them as individual expectations, as the final result is the combination of all of them.

It allows one argument to be specified or none at all: When a hostname is provided as an argument, the gatherer will return an array of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses. When no argument is provided, the gatherer will return a map with hostname as keys and arrays with IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses. Example arguments: Name Return value localhost list of IPs resolving node1 list of IPs resolving no argument provided map with hostnames and IP addresses Example specification: facts: - name: hosts_node1 gatherer: hosts argument: node1 - name: hosts_node2 gatherer: hosts argument: node2 - name: hosts_all gatherer: hosts Example output (in Rhai): // hosts_node1 [&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;::1&quot;]; // hosts_node2 [&quot;192.168.157.11&quot;]; // hosts_all \#{ &quot;localhost&quot;: [&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;::1&quot;], &quot;node1&quot;: [&quot;192.168.157.10&quot;], &quot;node2&quot;: [&quot;192.168.157.11&quot;], ... }; package_version Argument required : yes. This gatherer supports two usecases: get the version as a string of the specified package (useful to check if the installed version of a package is the same across multiple nodes) compare a given version string against the installed version string of a given package. While for the first usecase, a simple string containing the version is returned, for the second usecase, the return value is as follows (see additional details here ): A value of 0 if the provided version string matches the installed package version for the requested package. A value of -1 if the provided version string is older that what's currently installed. A value of 1 if the provided version string is newer than what's currently installed. Naming the facts / expectations accordingly is specially important here to avoid confusion. We suggest using a compare_ prefix for package version comparisons and package_ to retrieve a package version Additionally, when using the version comparison, it increases readability to explicitly mention the values to compare against: facts: - name: compare_package_corosync gatherer: package_version argument: corosync,2.4.5 values: - name: greater_than_installed default: 1 - name: lesser_than_installed default: -1 - name: same_as_installed default: 0 expectations: - name: compare_package_corosync expect: facts.compare_package_corosync == values.greater_than_installed Example arguments: Name Return value package_name a string containing the installed version of the rpm package package_name,2.4.5 an integer with a value of -1 , 0 or -1 (see above) Example specification: facts: - name: package_corosync gatherer: package_version argument: corosync - name: package_pacemaker gatherer: package_version argument: pacemaker - name: compare_package_corosync gatherer: package_version argument: corosync,2.4.5 ... Example output (in Rhai): // package_corosync &quot;2.4.5&quot;; // package_pacemaker &quot;2.0.4+20200616.2deceaa3a&quot;; // compare_package_corosync 0 saphostctrl Argument required : yes. This gatherer allows access to certain webmethods that saphostctrl implements. An argument is required to specify which webmethod should be called. This webmethod is passed to the saphostctrl command-line tool through the -function argument. Supported webmethods: Ping ListInstances A Ping call with a successful return should look like this: Example specification: facts: - name: ping gatherer: saphostctrl argument: Ping - name: list_instances gatherer: saphostctrl argument: ListInstances Example output (in Rhai): // ping \#{elapsed: 579770.0, status: &quot;SUCCESS&quot;} // list_instances [ \#{ &quot;changelist&quot;: 1908545, &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;vmhana01&quot;, &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;00&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;: 410, &quot;sapkernel&quot;: 753, &quot;system&quot;: &quot;PRD&quot; } ]; sbd_config Argument required : yes. This gatherer allows accessing the information contained in /etc/sysconfig/sbd Example arguments: Name Return value SBD_PACEMAKER extracted value from the config SBD_STARTMODE extracted value from the config SBD_DEVICE extracted value from the config Example specification: facts: - name: sbd_pacemaker gatherer: sbd_config argument: SBD_PACEMAKER - name: sbd_startmode gatherer: sbd_config argument: SBD_STARTMODE - name: sbd_device gatherer: sbd_config argument: SBD_DEVICE Example output (in Rhai): // sbd_pacemaker &quot;yes&quot;; // sbd_startmode &quot;always&quot;; // sbd_device &quot;/dev/vdc;/dev/vdb&quot;; sbd_dump Argument required : no. This gatherer allows accessing the sbd dump command output data. It executes the sbd -d &lt;device&gt; dump command in all devices configured in the SBD_DEVICE field on /etc/sysconfig/sbd and aggregates results in only one fact. Note that: no arguments are required if any of the dumps fail, a fact error is returned Dumped keys ( Timeout (watchdog) , Timeout (msgwait) , Number of slots , etc) are sanitized to simplify their access and usage in the expression language. Example specification: facts: - name: sbd_devices_dump gatherer: sbd_dump Example output (in Rhai): // sbd_devices_dump \#{ &quot;/dev/vdc&quot;: \#{ header_version: 2.1, number_of_slots: 255, sector_size: 512, timeout_allocate: 2, timeout_loop: 1, timeout_msgwait: 10, timeout_watchdog: 5, uuid: &quot;69048391-c647-4b34-a03a-f704f5cc2258&quot; } }; For extra information refer to trento-project/agent/../gatherers/sbddump_test.go systemd Argument required : yes. Gather systemd units state. It returns an active/inactive string. If the service is disabled or it does not exist, inactive is returned. Example arguments: Name Return value trento-agent state of the systemd unit facts: - name: sbd_state gatherer: systemd argument: sbd - name: corosync_state gatherer: systemd argument: corosync Example output (in Rhai): // sbd_state &quot;active&quot;; // corosync_state &quot;inactive&quot;; verify_password Argument required : yes. This gatherer determines whether a given user has its password still set to an unsafe password. It returns true if the password matches a password in the list of unsafe passwords, false otherwise. Specification examples: facts: - name: hacluster_has_default_password gatherer: verify_password argument: hacluster For the argument, only whitelisted users are allowed. Currently whitelisted usernames: hacluster List of unsafe passwords: linux Example output (in Rhai): // hacluster_has_default_password true;","ref":"gatherers.html#available-gatherers","title":"Gatherers - Available Gatherers","type":"extras"}]
